# Obsidian Email Viewer

**NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USE**

This plugin allows for viewing email (.eml) files within Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

Using [Postal Mime](https://github.com/postalsys/postal-mime) to do the heavy lifting.

Functionality is limited. Currently:

-   There are no headers displayed
-   There is no fallback if there is no HTML section of the email
-   Zero error reporting or handling
-   Probably a million more things I haven't even thought about. Right now it only shows the contents of the HTML section of the email. Nothing more! This does what I needed in the moment, I'll refine later. Maybe.

## Tested with the exported email file from:

-   Gmail
-
